			<h2>Testimonials</h2><br>
			<p1>
			<i>
			“As a fitness enthusiast, I have always strived to further enhance my athletic performance— especially when it came to physical strength since 
			it wasn’t my strongest suit. Through his proper and thorough instruction, Wu really helped me achieve my goal. An item especially worth noting about 
			Wu is his patience with ensuring that his client fully understands the technicality behind every movement so that they are able to execute 
			the form/technique with success. Being the hard sport that it is, powerlifting can be discouraging at times.. but Wu is always able to restore my confidence, 
			and even praises any accomplishments I have made along the way— no matter how big or small they are. It’s one thing to be a coach, 
			but it’s another to also be an interpersonal, strong supporter — something that Wu embodies.” – Amanda D.

			<i>
			“Being at the gym for almost 2 years, I was never really consistent and was always just going to the gym just to “lift”. 
			I only made minor progress as it was called “Newbie” gains. I have been under Wu’s wing for almost one year now and I can say he helped me be my 
			strongest self with more improvements to come. He helped me get dialed down and always stay focused when it came to my goal. When it came to 
			technique, he was always consistent with honest feedback and had input on things that I can always add to make my form better 
			or how to adjust it to make it more optimal. Wu’s programming was consistent and always 
			adjusted it to fit my needs and targeted any weaknesses I had.” – Eljohn A.</i></p2>
